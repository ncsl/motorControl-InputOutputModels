# Spectral Clustering of Motor Region Neurons

The dataset is organized by neurons, conditions and trial number with metadata concerning the brain region it is in, experimental cues and kinematic data.

Check ./graphs/ dir for the original graph produced using pairwise Pearson R correlation.

Check ./clusters/ dir for the computed clusters data structure using spectral clustering based on modularity optimization.
